# Localisation of Ontology Development Environments (LODE)

This repo contains Protégé plugins to render some of the interface and some of the Manchester syntax in a natural language other than English. 

## Create your own language plugin

There is no real coding involved to create your own language plugin, but mainly a translation. How you can do that is described in the how-to in the respective folder under "source".

The languages for which there are plugins currently are: Afrikaans and Spanish.

## Here are a few screenshots:
